## Game Logic Overview

The quiz game follows a sequential question flow with strict timing and scoring mechanics.

### Core Mechanics

1. **Question Sequence**: Questions are presented one at a time in order from the data source.
2. **Time Management**: Each question starts with 30 seconds. The timer counts down continuously.
3. **Answer Selection**: Players click on one of four multiple-choice options.
4. **Feedback Display**: After selection or timeout, feedback shows for 2 seconds.
5. **Scoring**: +1 point for correct answers, 0 for incorrect or timed out.
6. **Progression**: Moves to next question automatically after feedback, or ends game if last question.

### Timer Behavior

- Timer starts at 30 seconds for each question.
- Visual progress bar decreases in real-time.
- If timer reaches 0 without answer, automatically submits empty answer (counts as incorrect).
- Timer pauses during feedback display.

### Answer Handling

- Only one answer can be selected per question.
- Buttons disable after selection to prevent changes.
- Correct answers highlighted in green, incorrect selections in red.
- Correct answer revealed if player chose wrong.

### Scoring and Leaderboard

- Score increments only on correct answers.
- Leaderboard stores top 10 scores in localStorage.
- Entries include player name, score, and timestamp.
- Sorted by score descending, then by date.

### Game States

- **Active Game**: Displaying current question with timer running.
- **Feedback**: Showing answer result for 2 seconds.
- **Game Over**: Final screen with score submission and leaderboard view.
